# Serious Cat
Serious Cat for iPhone: never forget about job when you have difficult shifts schedule. Out of App Store.

Made just to help my friend stop forgetting about work shifts and to practice with some libraries and technologies.

#Footnote

Oh, yes, I wrote my own cordova app that needs by nobody.

This development has few objective: practice with Angular, Cordova, Github and with ancillary services and technologies. I want to understand the most advanced frontend technology, because it seems to me that I was lagging behind many developers.
